Eight hours of sleep is the recommended amount of time to accumulate since you're more prone to make mistakes if you're sleep deprived. Also lack of sleep causes stress. Getting enough sleep at night will make you feel more refreshed and ready to work the next day.</p>

Plan ahead for the things you know are going to happen to you that way you feel more ready. Most professional businessmen usually keep a planner with things that they know that they got to do for that day. TIME IS MONEY.</p>

You need to know how to take care of yourself before you can take care of others. You got to know how to live independently. </p>
