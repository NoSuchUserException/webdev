        <h1>Overtime and You</h1>
	    <p>
        Overtime can be an excellent way for employees to make extra money, as well as a way for a business to get extra productivity out of a possibly limited staff. However, this can often come at the cost of burnout. Even if an employee wants and seeks out overtime, this time may not be as productive if the employee is under excess stress or fatigue. Obviously this doesn't mean that denying overtime is the best way to prevent burnout, but this shows the overlying problem. Keeping an eye out for burnout or overworking can go a long ways towards productivity and helping employees make their own work-life balance.

        <h1>How less work can equal more</h1>
        <p>
        Unhappy workers can be a drag on operations. An employee which wants to go to work is going to be more productive, more reliable, more loyal, and more concerned with the success of the business. Making sure workloads are not too high, and making sure people are working on the things that interest them when possible are two easy ways to make this happen. Additionally, making sure an HR representative or department is dilligent of issues that arise is important as well. Inter-personal workplace issues can make a job miserable for employees involved. Another key item in making employees feel happy and appreciated is providing adequate vacation and sick leave. This is very important in allowing the employee time to maintain a work-life balance, which is extremely important. Most people are not "work-a-holics" and find having a life outside of work to be usually more important then their work itself. Vacation time allows you to make sure your employee's life is not dominated by work.

        <h1>Watching for signs of overwork</h1>
        <p>
        Overwork may be difficult to see in employees, especially as a manager. Employees may present their issues to their coworkers, but not to management directly. Maintaining a positive relationship between management and employees is important to make sure that they communicate any issues with their workload or personal life. Beyond them actually telling you, there are ways to watch for and avoid excessive workloads, and to find out if an employee may be having issues. An employee who is experiencing some sort of issue will often be less productive, they may look physically distraught or act reserved. This can sometimes be difficult to deal with, and talking directly to the employee may not always be appropriate. Making sure that employee's workload is not excessive, and making sure they do not feel targeted in any way help. Often this is caused by an issue in the employee's personal life and will not be solved at work. Making sure work isn't an added problem in their life is important.
